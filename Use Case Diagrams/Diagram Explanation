These diagrams represent the functional requirements of your project: using the Steam API to pull data, analyzing it, and providing coaching to the player.

1. Guest User vs. Registered User

The project distinguishes between two levels of access. This is a common design to encourage user retention (moving from Guest to Registered).

Guest User (Limited Access)

The "Guest User" diagram typically focuses on **discovery and basic utility**.

* Actor: The "Guest User" (stick figure) is outside the system boundary.
* Key Use Cases:
* Search/View Player Stats: This likely involves the chatbot fetching public data from the **Steam API** without requiring the user to log in.
* General Game Analysis: A basic overview of performance based on public match history.
* Register/Sign Up: A critical path that allows the Guest to transition into a Registered User.



Registered User (Full Access)

The "Registered User" diagram shows the **core value proposition** of your project.

* Actor: "Registered User" (often inherits capabilities from the Guest User).
* Key Use Cases:
* Login/Authentication: Ensuring the data is private and tied to a specific Steam ID.
* Deep Game Analysis: Unlike the guest version, this might look at long-term trends, specific playstyles, or hidden metrics.
* Personalized Coaching: This is where the AI takes the analyzed data and generates specific advice (e.g., "Your gold-per-minute is low in the mid-game; focus on farming these camps").
* Progress Tracking: Viewing how their performance has improved over time thanks to the chatbot's lessons.




2. Understanding the Relationships

In these diagrams, you likely see arrows with specific labels. Here is what they mean in the context of your chatbot:

| Relationship | Meaning in Your Project | Example |

 <<include>> | Mandatory: The base action cannot happen without this step. | "Analyze Game" `<<include>>` "Fetch Data from Steam API." |
 <<extend>> | Optional: An extra feature that only happens under certain conditions. | "View Stats" `<<extend>>` "Share to Social Media." |
 **Association (Solid Line) | Represents the interaction between the user and the specific function. | A line from the "Player" to the "Ask for Coaching" bubble. |


 3. The Technical Flow (System Boundary)

The large box in your diagrams represents the **System Boundary** (your Chatbot App). Everything inside the box is what your code does; everything outside is the "Actor" (the Human Player).

1. Input: The user interacts with the Chatbot (Telegram, Discord, or Web UI).
2. External Request: The Chatbot reaches out to the **Steam API** (represented as a "Secondary Actor" or a system outside the box).
3. Processing: The "Analysis Engine" processes the JSON data from Steam.
4. Output: The "Coaching Module" sends a message back to the user with actionable advice.
