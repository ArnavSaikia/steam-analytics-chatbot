1. Guest User vs. Registered User
The system distinguishes between two levels of access to ensure privacy, personalization, and controlled feature access.
Guest User (Limited Access)
The Guest User diagram represents basic system access before authentication.

Actor: Guest User (outside the system boundary).
Purpose: Exploration and onboarding.
Key Use Cases:
View Supported Queries: Allows guests to see supported features.
View Sample Statistics: Displays demo data without accessing personal information.
Register/Login: Facilitates the transition to a Registered User.


Registered User (Full Access)
The Registered User diagram represents the core functionality for authenticated gamers.
Actor: Registered User.
Purpose: Personalized statistics analysis and visualization.
Key Use Cases:
Save / Update Steam ID: Associates a specific Steam account with the profile.
Query & View Steam Statistics:** Retrieves and displays processed results.
View Charts and Graphs: Generates visual playtime distributions and trends.
Recommend Similar Games: Suggests titles based on playtime patterns and genres.


2. Generalized System Architecture & External Integration**
The Generalized UML Diagram** provides a high-level view of how the system interacts with external entities to fulfill these requests.
External Actor: Steam Web API
Unlike internal processes, the Steam Web API is represented as an external entity that the system communicates with to fulfill data-heavy use cases.
Extended Functionality:
Check Global Most Played Games: The system can pull aggregated global data from the API, separate from individual user data.
Filter by Genre/Tag: An <<extend>> relationship allows users to optionally narrow down global or personal statistics.
View Achievements & Market Value:** Advanced use cases that include calculating the "Market Value" of a library based on playtime or tracking specific game achievements.
Friends' Stats Comparison: An optional <<extend>> feature that allows users to compare their performance metrics against their Steam friends list.



3. Understanding the Relationships
The diagrams define how use cases interact through specific UML relationships.
<<include>> Relationship (Mandatory):
Represents internal steps required for a use case to complete.
Example: "Query Steam Statistics" <<include>> "Detect User Intent" and "Fetch Steam Data".
Example: "Recommend Games" <<include>> "Based on Playtime Tags/Reviews".

<<extend>> Relationship (Optional):
Used for features that only trigger under specific conditions.
Example: "Check Global Most Played Games" <<extend>> "Filter by Genre/Tag".
Example: "Check User's Most Played Games" <<extend>> "View Friends' Stats Comparison".


4. System Boundary & Technical Flow**
The large rectangle defines the System Boundary of the Intelligent Steam Statistics Chatbot.
1. Input: The Registered User initiates a query via the UI.
2. Intent & Validation: The system utilizes the Gemini API to detect intent and validates it against modular rules.
3.Data Retrieval: The system makes a request to the Steam Web API to pull raw player or global data.
4. Processing: The system aggregates metrics, computes playtime trends, and generates chart data.
5. Output: The chatbot returns text-based coaching, visual graphs, or game recommendations.


5. Core Purpose of the Diagrams
These diagrams collectively demonstrate:
Role-Based Access Control: Differentiating between Guest and Registered levels.
External Integration: Clear boundaries between the Chatbot logic and the Steam Web API.
Task Automation: How intent detection leads to automated data fetching and processing.
Recommendation Logic: The transition from raw playtime data to personalized game suggestions.
