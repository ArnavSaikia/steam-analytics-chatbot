These diagrams represent the functional requirements of the Intelligent Steam Statistics Chatbot. The system allows users to authenticate, query Steam statistics, generate charts and graphs, and receive rule-based game recommendations. The system retrieves data using the Steam Web API, detects user intent using Gemini API, and executes predefined tasks using modular rule-based logic.

1. Guest User vs. Registered User

The system distinguishes between two levels of access to ensure privacy, personalization, and controlled feature access.

Guest User (Limited Access)

The Guest User diagram represents basic system access before authentication.

Actor: Guest User (outside the system boundary).

Purpose: Exploration and onboarding.

Key Use Cases:

View Supported Queries
Allows guests to see what types of statistics and features the chatbot supports.

View Sample Statistics
Displays example charts or demo data without accessing personal Steam information.

Register
Allows a guest to create an account.

Login
Allows the guest to transition into a Registered User.

Guest users do not access personal Steam statistics or recommendations.

Registered User (Full Access)

The Registered User diagram represents the core functionality of the system.

Actor: Registered User (authenticated gamer).

Purpose: Personalized statistics analysis and visualization.

Key Use Cases:

Login / Authentication
Ensures secure and private access.

Save / Update Steam ID
Associates a Steam account with the user profile.

Query Steam Statistics
Allows users to ask questions such as:

“How much have I played Elden Ring?”

“Show my most played games.”

“Show my total playtime.”

View Steam Statistics
Displays processed results based on Steam data.

View Charts and Graphs
Generates visualizations such as:

Playtime distribution (bar chart)

Game category breakdown (pie chart)

Time spent trends

Recommend Similar Games
Suggests games based on:

Most played genres

Frequently played game categories

Playtime patterns
(Implemented using rule-based recommendation logic, not predictive AI.)

Logout
Ends the session securely.

2. Understanding the Relationships

The diagrams include UML relationships that define how use cases interact.

<<include>> Relationship

Represents mandatory internal steps required for a use case to complete.

Examples in this project:

"Query Steam Statistics" <<include>> "Detect User Intent"

"Query Steam Statistics" <<include>> "Fetch Steam Data"

"View Charts and Graphs" <<include>> "Process Statistics Data"

"Recommend Similar Games" <<include>> "Analyze Play Patterns"

This means the main action cannot occur without these internal processes.

Association Relationship (Solid Line)

Represents interaction between an actor and a use case.

Examples:

Registered User — Query Steam Statistics

Registered User — View Charts and Graphs

Guest User — Register

<<extend>> Relationship (Optional Use)

Used only if an action optionally extends another.

Example (if implemented):

"View Steam Statistics" <<extend>> "Export Chart as Image"

This means exporting is optional and only happens if the user chooses.

3. System Boundary Explanation

The large rectangle in the diagram represents the System Boundary, which defines the scope of the Intelligent Steam Statistics Chatbot.

Everything inside the boundary is implemented by your application.
Everything outside represents external actors.

Important Clarification:
External APIs such as Steam Web API and Gemini API are not actors in the use case diagram because they do not initiate interaction. They are external services used internally by the system.

4. Technical Flow (Behavioral View)

Input
The Registered User interacts with the chatbot interface (Web UI).

Intent Detection
The system sends the user query to the Gemini API to classify intent.

Rule-Based Validation
The system validates the detected intent using modular rule-based logic.

Data Retrieval
The system fetches relevant data from the Steam Web API.

Processing
The system:

Aggregates playtime

Sorts games

Computes statistics

Generates chart data

Applies recommendation rules

Output
The chatbot returns:

Text-based statistics

Charts and graphs

Game recommendations

5. Core Purpose of the Diagrams

These use case diagrams demonstrate:

Role-based access control (Guest vs Registered)

Authentication handling

Task execution automation

Data visualization functionality

Rule-based recommendation system

Clear system scope and boundaries

They capture the behavioral aspects of the software from the user’s perspective and define how different features are accessed and executed.
