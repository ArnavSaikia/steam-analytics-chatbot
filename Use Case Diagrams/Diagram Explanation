1. Core Actors

The diagram identifies two primary entities interacting with the Steam Analytics Chatbot System:

* User: The human player who initiates queries to analyze their gaming habits or explore global data.
* Steam Web API: An external system actor that provides the raw data necessary for the chatbot to perform its analysis.


2. Primary Use Cases

The system is designed around four main functional areas:

* Check Game Statistics: General querying of gaming data.
* Check Global Most Played Games: Retrieving data on trending titles across the entire Steam platform.
* Check User's Most Played Games: A personalized analysis of a specific player's library and habits.
* Recommend Games: An automated suggestion engine based on user behavior.

3. Functional Relationships (Include & Extend)

The diagram uses standard UML notation to show how complex tasks are broken down:

Include Relationships (Mandatory Steps)
These sub-tasks must occur for the main use case to be successful:

* Check User's Most Played Games includes:
* View Achievements: Tracking specific player milestones.
* View Playtime Played Games: Calculating hours spent in-game.


* View Playtime Played Games includes:
* Based on Playtime View Market Value: A specialized calculation of account value relative to time invested.
* Recommend Games includes:
* Based on Playtime Tags/Reviews: 
* ⁠Using community data and personal history to refine suggestions.



Extend Relationships (Optional Features)

These features provide additional functionality if the user chooses to use them:

* Filter by Genre/Tag: Users can optionally narrow down global or personal "Most Played" lists by specific categories.
* View Friends' Stats Comparison: Allows the user to optionally compare their playtime and stats against people on their friends list.


4. Data Flow Architecture

The diagram visually separates the System Boundary(the chatbot application) from the External Data Source (Steam Web API):

1. The User sends a request into the system.
2. The system identifies which Use Case is being triggered.
3. The system makes a backend call to the Steam Web API to fetch the relevant data packets.
4. The system processes that data internally (calculating market value, comparing friend stats, or filtering by tags) before presenting it back to the User.
