REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS REPORT
INTELLIGENT STEAM STATISTICS CHATBOT

INTRODUCTION

Online gaming platforms generate a large amount of user data such as owned games, playtime, achievements,
and recent activity.Steam users often need to manually browse their profiles or use third-party websites 
to analyze this data, which can be time-consuming and inconvenient.

This project proposes an Intelligent Steam Statistics Chatbot that allows users to query their Steam 
gaming statistics using simple text-based commands. The system retrieves player data using the Steam Web 
API, detects user intent using Gemini’s API, and presents the requested statistics in a clear and user 
friendly format.

OBJECTIVES

- Provide a chatbot-based interface for querying Steam user statistics
- Automate the retrieval of gaming data using the Steam Web API
- Implement a secure user login system
- Store user-specific Steam IDs
- Detect user intent using Gemini’s intent detection API
- Execute tasks using rule-based logic
- To present gaming statistics in a simple and readable format

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

- Allow users to register using a username and password.
- Allow users to log in and log out securely.
- Store user credentials securely in the database.
- Allow users to save their Steam user ID in their profile.
- Allow users to enter text-based chatbot queries.
- Detect user's intent using gemini's API.
- Validate detected intents using rule-based logic.
- Retrieve user statistics using the Steam Web API.
- Process raw API data to generate summarized results.
- Display Steam statistics in a user-friendly format.
- Display appropriate error messages for invalid input or API failure.

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

- The system should respond within an acceptable time for user queries. 
- The system should provide consistent results for identical queries.
- The chatbot interface should be easy to use
- User credentials must be stored securely (hashed passwords)
- API keys must be protected from unauthorized access.
- The rule-based intent handling logic should be modular in design so that new query 
  types and tasks can be added in the future without modifying existing functionality.


USERS OF THE SYSTEM

Gamers: Steam users who want to view their gaming statistics
External Users: user who would only explore the website

PROBABLE SYSTEM DESIGN

The Intelligent Steam Statistics Chatbot would be built as a web-based system where users interact through a browser while all processing happens on a centralized server. The design follows a modular approach so that different components of the system can be developed, maintained, and upgraded independently.

Frontend Design
The user-facing part of the system would be a simple web application. Users would first see registration and login pages where they can create an account and sign in securely. After logging in, they would have access to a profile page where they can save or update their Steam ID. The main feature of the interface would be a chatbot-style text box where users can type natural language queries such as “Show my most played game” or “List my recently played games.” The responses from the system would appear in a clean, readable format, using simple text summaries or structured lists instead of raw data. Clear error messages would also be displayed if something goes wrong.

Backend Design
The backend would act as the core of the system and handle all processing. It would first manage user authentication, ensuring that passwords are stored securely using hashing techniques and that user sessions are properly maintained. When a user sends a chat message, the backend would forward the text to Gemini’s API to determine the user’s intent. Once the intent is identified, a rule-based module would validate it and decide what action needs to be performed. For example, if the intent is to fetch playtime statistics, the system would call the appropriate Steam Web API endpoint. The backend would then process the raw data returned by Steam, filter out unnecessary details, and generate a meaningful summary before sending it back to the chatbot interface.

Database Design
A relational database would be used to store user information securely. One table would store user credentials such as usernames and hashed passwords. Another table would link each user account to their saved Steam ID. Optionally, the system could also maintain a log of past chatbot queries for analysis or future improvements. Sensitive information like API keys would not be stored in the database but managed separately through secure environment variables.

External APIs and Integration
The system would rely on two main external services. The Steam Web API would provide access to gaming statistics such as owned games, playtime, achievements, and recent activity. Gemini’s API would be used to interpret user messages and detect their intent in natural language, reducing the need for rigid command formats. Gemini API might be hard to use without hitting rate limits. Exploring local LLM models might be worth here

Overall Data Flow
When a user submits a query, it is first sent to the backend. The backend forwards the message to Gemini for intent detection. After receiving the detected intent, the rule-based logic decides which Steam API call is required. The requested data is then retrieved, processed, summarized, and finally displayed to the user through the chatbot interface
