REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS REPORT
INTELLIGENT STEAM STATISTICS CHATBOT

INTRODUCTION

Online gaming platforms generate a large amount of user data such as owned games, playtime, achievements,
and recent activity.Steam users often need to manually browse their profiles or use third-party websites 
to analyze this data, which can be time-consuming and inconvenient.

This project proposes an Intelligent Steam Statistics Chatbot that allows users to query their Steam 
gaming statistics using simple text-based commands. The system retrieves player data using the Steam Web 
API, detects user intent using Gemini’s API, and presents the requested statistics in a clear and user 
friendly format.

OBJECTIVES

- Provide a chatbot-based interface for querying Steam user statistics
- Automate the retrieval of gaming data using the Steam Web API
- Implement a secure user login system
- Store user-specific Steam IDs
- Detect user intent using Gemini’s intent detection API
- Execute tasks using rule-based logic
- To present gaming statistics in a simple and readable format

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

- Allow users to register using a username and password.
- Allow users to log in and log out securely.
- Store user credentials securely in the database.
- Allow users to save their Steam user ID in their profile.
- Allow users to enter text-based chatbot queries.
- Detect user's intent using gemini's API.
- Validate detected intents using rule-based logic.
- Retrieve user statistics using the Steam Web API.
- Process raw API data to generate summarized results.
- Display Steam statistics in a user-friendly format.
- Display appropriate error messages for invalid input or API failure.

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

- The system should respond to user queries within an acceptable timeframe to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.
- The system should provide consistent and reliable results when processing identical queries, ensuring data integrity and predictability.
- The chatbot interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily navigate and interact with the system without requiring extensive training or documentation.
- User credentials must be stored securely using strong cryptographic hashing algorithms (such as bcrypt or Argon2) to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.
- API keys and sensitive authentication tokens must be protected from unauthorized access through secure storage mechanisms, such as environment variables or secure vaults, and should never be hardcoded in the application.
- The rule-based intent handling logic should be designed with modularity in mind, allowing new query types and functional tasks to be added to the system in the future without requiring modifications to existing code or disrupting current functionality.


USERS OF THE SYSTEM

Gamers: Steam users who want to view their gaming statistics
External Users: user who would only explore the website

PROBABLE SYSTEM DESIGN

The Intelligent Steam Statistics Chatbot would be built as a web-based system where users interact through a browser while all processing happens on a centralized server. The design follows a modular approach so that different components of the system can be developed, maintained, and upgraded independently.

Frontend Design
The user-facing part of the system would be a simple web application. Users would first see registration and login pages where they can create an account and sign in securely. After logging in, they would have access to a profile page where they can save or update their Steam ID. The main feature of the interface would be a chatbot-style text box where users can type natural language queries such as “Show my most played game” or “List my recently played games.” The responses from the system would appear in a clean, readable format, using simple text summaries or structured lists instead of raw data. Clear error messages would also be displayed if something goes wrong.

Backend Design
The backend would act as the core processing component of the system, responsible for orchestrating all server-side operations and business logic. It would first implement a comprehensive user authentication module, ensuring that user passwords are securely hashed using industry-standard algorithms (such as bcrypt or Argon2) and that user sessions are properly maintained with appropriate timeout mechanisms and token management. When a user submits a chat message through the frontend interface, the backend would forward the user's text input to Gemini's API service to perform natural language processing and determine the user's underlying intent. Once the intent has been identified and extracted from Gemini's response, a rule-based validation and decision-making module would evaluate the detected intent against predefined rules to determine what specific action or API call needs to be executed. For example, if the detected intent is to fetch playtime statistics for the user's games, the system would invoke the appropriate Steam Web API endpoint with the user's Steam ID and required parameters. The backend would then retrieve and process the raw, unfiltered data returned by the Steam API, apply filtering and transformation logic to remove unnecessary or irrelevant details, and generate a meaningful, user-friendly summary before transmitting the final result back to the chatbot interface for display to the user.

Database Design
A relational database would be used to store user information securely. One table would store user credentials such as usernames and hashed passwords. Another table would link each user account to their saved Steam ID. Optionally, the system could also maintain a log of past chatbot queries for analysis or future improvements. Sensitive information like API keys would not be stored in the database but managed separately through secure environment variables.

External APIs and Integration
The system would rely on two main external services. The Steam Web API would provide access to gaming statistics such as owned games, playtime, achievements, and recent activity. Gemini’s API would be used to interpret user messages and detect their intent in natural language, reducing the need for rigid command formats. Gemini API might be hard to use without hitting rate limits. Exploring local LLM models might be worth here

Overall Data Flow
When a user submits a query, it is first sent to the backend. The backend forwards the message to Gemini for intent detection. After receiving the detected intent, the rule-based logic decides which Steam API call is required. The requested data is then retrieved, processed, summarized, and finally displayed to the user through the chatbot interface

What we want to achive all through this, is a efficient chatbot that can reflects the statistics of a player for a particular game.
In the world of constant inclination of gaming tech gaints our contribution is crucial for developments of the players.
We provide a service that works as a guide to players who wants hone their skill but lacks the czpital to hire professionals.
The chatbot speaks things clearly so that, the player could actually improve his experience. This chatbot could be added to particular games, but this version is general one.
