Here is a professionally formatted **`STEAM_API_GUIDE.md`** file. I have designed it to be clean, technical, and ready for a GitHub repository.

Steam API Data Collection & Integration

This document outlines the technical strategy for utilizing the Steam Web API to power the chatbot's game analysis and coaching features.

Overview

The chatbot functions by acting as a bridge between the **Steam Web API** and our **Analysis Engine**. It retrieves raw match data, parses performance metrics, and feeds them into the AI to generate personalized coaching feedback.

Prerequisites

* **Steam Web API Key:** Obtained via [steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).
* **Library:** `requests` for Python or `axios` for Node.js.
* **User Permission:** Players must set their "Privacy Settings" to **Public** and enable **"Expose Public Match Data"** in-game.

API Endpoints & Usage

1. Resolving User Identity

To fetch data, we need the `SteamID64`. If a user provides a custom URL, we use the `ResolveVanityURL` interface.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `ISteamUser/ResolveVanityURL/v0001/` | Converts a custom profile name to a SteamID64. |
| `GET` | `ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v0002/` | Retrieves basic profile info (Name, Avatar). |

2. Fetching Match History

This is the primary data source for the "Guest User" and "Registered User" analysis.

* **Interface:** `IDOTA2Match_570` (Example for Dota 2) or `ISteamUserStats` (Global).
* **Endpoint:** `GetMatchHistory`
* **Parameters:** `account_id`, `matches_requested=10`

3. Detailed Match Analysis

To provide **Coaching**, we pull granular data from specific matches.

* **Endpoint:** `GetMatchDetails`
* **Key Metrics Collected:**
* **Last Hits / Denies:** Evaluates early-game efficiency.
* **Gold Per Minute (GPM):** Measures resource management.
* **Death Timeline:** Identifies positioning errors or poor map awareness.
* **Item Purchase Timestamps:** Analyzes power-spike utilization.



Data Flow Architecture

1. **Request:** User inputs `/analyze [SteamID]` into the Chatbot.
2. **Fetch:** Chatbot sends an authenticated request to the Steam API.
3. **Clean:** System filters out irrelevant data (bot matches, abandoned games).
4. **Analyze:** The AI compares the player's stats against "Pro-Tier" benchmarks for that specific hero/rank.
5. **Report:** The Chatbot returns a summary with **3 actionable tips** for improvement.



Sample Implementation (Python)

```python
import requests

class SteamDataCollector:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.base_url = "http://api.steampowered.com"

    def get_player_matches(self, steam_id, game_id="570"):
        """Fetches the last 5 matches for a specific player."""
        endpoint = f"{self.base_url}/IDOTA2Match_{game_id}/GetMatchHistory/v1/"
        params = {
            'key': self.api_key,
            'account_id': steam_id,
            'matches_requested': 5
        }
        
        try:
            response = requests.get(endpoint, params=params)
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.json().get('result', {}).get('matches', [])
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Error fetching data: {e}")
            return None

# Usage
# collector = SteamDataCollector("YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
# matches = collector.get_player_matches("76561198XXXXXXXXX")

```



Limitations & Handling

* **Rate Limits:** We implement a **Redis Cache** to store match results for 6 hours to avoid hitting the 100k daily request limit.
* **Privacy:** If `communityvisibilitystate` is not `3`, the chatbot will prompt the user to make their profile public.
* **Latency:** API calls are handled asynchronously to ensure the chatbot remains responsive during data fetching.
